# Library Managment System

Creating a Library Management System (LMS) using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) requires a clear understanding of the system's requirements, followed by the design of classes that represent the various entities and their interactions. Below are the essential requirements along with the OOP concepts that can be utilized to develop a basic LMS.

OOP Concepts and Design
To fulfill these requirements through OOP, we can define several classes and their relationships:

Classes:
Book: This class represents a book in the library.

Properties: Title, Author, ISBN, Genre, NumberOfCopies, AvailableCopies, etc.
Methods: UpdateBookInfo(), CheckAvailability(), etc.
**User **: This class represents a library user.

Properties: Name, UserID, ContactInfo, BorrowingHistory, Role, etc.
Methods: Register(), UpdateInfo(), BorrowBook(), ReturnBook(), etc.
Admin: This class inherits from User and has additional privileges.

Methods: AddBook(), RemoveBook(), GenerateReport(), etc.
Librarian: This class also inherits from User and has specific responsibilities related to managing the library's inventory.

BorrowTransaction: This class represents the transaction of borrowing a book.

Properties: TransactionID, Book, User, BorrowDate, DueDate, ReturnDate, Fine, etc.
Library: This class manages the collection of books and users.

Properties: Books, Users, Transactions, etc.
Methods: AddBook(), RegisterUser (), SearchBook(), IssueBook(), ReturnBook(), etc.
Relationships:
User and Book: There exists a many-to-many relationship between users and books through the BorrowTransaction class.
Admin and Librarian: Both classes are specialized types of User, demonstrating inheritance.
Library: Acts as an aggregate root that oversees the collections of Book and User objects.
This structured approach using OOP principles will facilitate the development of a robust Library Management System.
